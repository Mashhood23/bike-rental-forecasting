# Findings & Conclusions

- **Strong Seasonal Patterns:** The data exhibits robust seasonality, with clear peaks and troughs that align with weather variations and calendar effects, such as weekends and holidays.
- **Temperature Sensitivity:** A high positive correlation between temperature and total rentals confirms that warmer days attract significantly more riders.
- **Calendar-Based Trends:** Weekends, holidays, and non-working days show markedly different demand dynamics compared to weekdays.
- **Effective Forecasting Models:**
  - Auto ARIMA provided the most statistically robust fit with the lowest AIC (6097.63) and residual autocorrelation near zero, making it ideal for short-term predictions.
  - Manual ARIMA (1,1,1) was also effective but had higher error metrics (e.g., RMSE = 812.91 vs. 697.81 for Auto ARIMA).
- **Residual Diagnostics:**
  - The Shapiro-Wilk test revealed non-normality of residuals, indicating possible model refinement areas.
  - ACF and PACF plots confirmed no strong autocorrelation in residuals, validating model appropriateness for forecasting.
- **Data Quality:** Preprocessing such as outlier smoothing, decomposition, and stationarity adjustments were critical in improving model performance and interpretability.

This time series forecasting project successfully modeled the **daily bike rental demand** for the Capital Bikeshare system. The rigorous data cleaning, decomposition, and stationarity testing ensured a stable time series structure conducive to ARIMA modeling. The use of both **manual and automated ARIMA models** enabled comparative diagnostics, where Auto ARIMA was preferred due to its lower error metrics and better residual properties.

Overall, this analysis demonstrates the feasibility of **data-driven demand forecasting** in urban mobility. It highlights how **weather** and **calendar** features critically influence public transportation usage. These insights are highly valuable for urban planners and operational teams aiming to optimize bike distribution, plan fleet expansion, or build adaptive pricing strategies.

The project not only meets the goals of forecasting but also illustrates the importance of statistical rigor in transforming raw data into **actionable intelligence**.
